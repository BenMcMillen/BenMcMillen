## Hey there 👋  
I'm a casual academic and final-year **Computer Science and Mechatronics Engineering** student at UNSW Sydney. Most of my recent work focuses on my thesis, where I designed and simulated a **vortex-induced vibration (VIV) piezoelectric energy harvester** for underwater ROVs using ANSYS. 🌊⚙️

## Developed Projects  
**Piezoelectric Energy Harvester (Thesis)** → Simulated vortex-induced vibrations, multi-harvester interactions, and enclosure design to optimise energy generation for autonomous underwater systems. 🔋🌱  
**ParkPilot** → Contributed to the full-stack development of a smart-parking and carbon-tracking application using React Native and FastAPI/Flask. 🚗📱  
**Robot Implementation** → Coded the backend for 4-wheel robot implementation, working with object oriented programming principles including abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.
**Hand Gesture Robot** → Developed a robot capable of movement via real-time hand-gesture recognition using Arduino and embedded sensing. 🤖🖐️   
**Maze Solver** → Maze generation and solving program that demonstrates the use of both Depth First Search and Breadth First Search Algorithms.

## Academic Work  
As a **Casual Academic**, I teach and support large student cohorts across UNSW courses:  
- **Engineering Mechanics 2** (MMAN2300) ⚙️  
- **Computing Applications in Mechatronics** (MTRN3500) 💻  
- **Robot Design** (MTRN3100) 🤖  
- **Engineering Design & Professional Practice** (DESN2000) 🧩  

I enjoy breaking down complex engineering concepts and helping students debug everything from C++ and Arduino code to robotics design problems. 📚✨
