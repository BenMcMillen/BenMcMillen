## Hey there 👋  
I'm a casual academic and final-year **Computer Science and Mechatronics Engineering** student at UNSW Sydney. Most of my recent work focuses on my thesis, where I designed and simulated a **vortex-induced vibration (VIV) piezoelectric energy harvester** for underwater ROVs using ANSYS. 🌊⚙️

## Developed Projects  
[**Piezoelectric Energy Harvester (Thesis)**](https://github.com/BenMcMillen/Undergraduate-Thesis) → Simulated vortex-induced vibrations, multi-harvester interactions, and enclosure design to optimise energy generation for autonomous underwater systems. 🔋🌱  
[**ParkPilot**](https://github.com/unsw-cse-comp99-3900/capstone-project-25t3-3900-f11a-date) → Contributed to the full-stack development of a smart-parking and carbon-tracking application using React Native and FastAPI/Flask. 🚗📱  
[**Personal Website**](https://personal-website-iota-three-40.vercel.app/) → Developed personal website to display current projects using ReactJS and JavaScript.📱  
**Robot Implementation** [Request for Access] → Coded the backend for a 4-wheel robot implementation, applying object-oriented programming principles including abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  
[**Hand Gesture Robot**](https://github.com/BenMcMillen/HandGestureRobot) → Developed a robot capable of movement via real-time hand-gesture recognition using Arduino and embedded sensing. 🤖🖐️  
[**Maze Solver**](https://github.com/BenMcMillen/Maze-Solver) → Maze generation and solving program demonstrating Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithms. 🧩

## Academic Work  
As a **Casual Academic**, I teach and support large student cohorts across UNSW courses:  
- **Engineering Mechanics 2** (MMAN2300) ⚙️  
- **Computing Applications in Mechatronics** (MTRN3500) 💻  
- **Robot Design** (MTRN3100) 🤖  
- **Engineering Design & Professional Practice** (DESN2000) 🧩  

I enjoy breaking down complex engineering concepts and helping students debug everything from C++ and Arduino code to robotics design problems. 📚✨
